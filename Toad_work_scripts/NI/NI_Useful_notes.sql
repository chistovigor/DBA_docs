-- cons for TEAM

Munaf: dm disk issue, pending taks for SR (related to w4 proactive check), stopped oswbb after AHF installation

Bhavna: sometimes some failures because of mistakes (drop DB with Y, crontab entries not commented), pending more than MONTH for catlogDB patching, UAT datapatch issue (!)

Raj: Multiple reminders for JIRA, BAU tasks related to init files, SourceTREE, Performance tuning, compatible parameter in multiple upgraded DBs (explained 2-3 times),
Pre auth DB config files (3-4 reminders, still files ARE wrong), Way4DB space analysis - multiple reminders - nothing done, SR for cluster wait events - mistakes,
dcmsDB upgrade - not informed anyone about delay (Rasmi raised concerns), no responce by phone after that
wlile upload the data, no subtasks in CR for EMS post DB upgradation (miltiple times), dropped reports server repository DB, ignored patch instructions for UAT
NOT uploaded stats gathering script for the xlsdb server at all, NONE of upgraded DBs are in OEM (including xls)

ALL: in skype after 4pm sometimes I am not able to see people (offline 1h+ at 5pm), sometimes no responce by phone as well

-- Questions for Mukarram

15.09.2020 (sent mail Tue 9/15/2020 6:12 PM)

1) Salary October increment (250aed was for 2018-2019). Now global team + 
2) Cloud DBs: how much expected, what about licences/support ? No resources for that. EULA was not included
3) All weekends DBA working (same as UNIX for patching + more for projects - like PCMS migration, GGS upgrade, parallel runs, etc). 
Resource question - we have already saved from Mar/Apr we have reduced 2 consultants 15-20k aed/month each (cost for NI). 40*6 = 240k aed
4) Leave planning - UAE/Global - can we do at least in end of 2020 ?
5) Remote work possibility - for 2021 - at least limited period (6-7 months per ye(ar) - meeting with Hend, they will raise policy for that

07.10.2020 (sent mail Thu 10/8/2020 12:13 PM)

1) CyberARC for Nigeria (or ONLY Egypt)? - it for Egypt - done
2) Jordan patching for WL + some non critical DB during CFILE - send Prasanth  email for Infosec (?) - done
3) Salary for new role - are they going to increase or not? Work increased - will discuss in meeting with Prasanth (till now clarity)
4) Budget approvals dates for this year - beginning of November - in progress
5) Update the Infrastructure PPD document - for technology updates - ask Ginny to send last PPD document, I will lines related to our activity - done
6) Approval for RSA alerts testing - resend email - done
7) JIRA UNIX team do not like, OK. Which other collaboration tool we need to use? - JIRA is OK, better than mail - done
8) Oracle MDS for Jordan for 11g? What is required for approval? - Mukarram will take care about approvals + PRM for UAE will add - done

9) way4 DB upgradation related disks (mail Wed 10/7/2020 9:16 AM from Munaf), 5 reminder to UNIX team, still no disks - 3rd point in the team meeting - waiting for Ajai
10) HSK DB for way4 - pending from 22 July (!) - 2nd point in the team meeting - waiting for Ajai
11) Issue with non supported UAT HW server (mail to UNIX team today/yesterday) - put in team meeting (Ajai will explain) - waiting for Ajai

03.2021

Discussed

1) New DBA - no clarity, no movement, BUDGET info is MANDATORY - I do not have it - Mukarram/Prasanth to discuss with Hasan (Egypt)
2) Guardium  - how to support? Infosec rejected to take responsibility for that - need to FIXED scope of work to be done by WHOM
3) Jordan: MDS - no update, Upgradation - no update (no budget) - need from me: 11:30am Rishin/Ajai (30 min meeting) - waiting for budget
4) Cloud for Oracle - no responce from UNIX team - POC, responce I will get after DC migration
5) Testing of clone improvement - suggested disable backup - take clone after begin backup, change process after
6) Patching for way4 2021 Q1 - 40 defects, 20+ critical one, Raj/Munaf not able to resolve those
7) 2020 bonus/increment - no emails, nothing - will come (but when?)
8) What is the best way of reach Mukarram - maybe 1 meeting / week at convenient time? - scheduled weekly meeting
9) What is the problem with ControlM/Neo/PRM (Rashmi) team - why no responce from them neither to DBA no to IMP ? - done discussion with VAS, sent email, PM required
10) Leaves - I want to schedule for 1-1.5 weeks starting from March is it fine? - I will schedule from 22 to 25 March 2021 (4 days)

18.03.2021

1) Update from my recent MM: related to issue with PPROD disks, mount points provision
2) PPROD servers onboarding into CyberARC ?
3) Patching/Upgradation of w4 - email sent (Prasanth in cc as well)
4) New DBA ?

2) Munaf

2.1 BCP scripts/testing - 2 months
2.2 Reports server updgade
2. Control-M automation


3) Raj

 MongoDB, MySQL db BCP instructions
 
-- IMPROVEMENTS 2019-2020:

Monitoring of PROD databases tablespaces (prod support)

Before:

Frequent false alerts because of the monitoring not aware of autoextend feature of oracle DB tablespaces, loosing time for check those alerts, HSK related alerts

After: 

Upgade BMC monitoring tools for additional setup in order to maintain autoextend feature in PROD monitoring, HSK alerts auto handled as per w4 app behaviour 

PROD/pprod DB dynamic inventory (prod support)

Before:

No single point of thuth regarding DB hosted in NI PROD servers, all infomation can be captured only manually, not updated

After:

Discovery happened automatically for all PROD/PPROD UAE DB servers and weekly mail can be sent to anyone who need DB invenory (now DBA and UAE infosec), 
recent data also available anytime by request from BMC discovery interface


Outdated version of oracle sw usage (prod support)

Before:

None of DB or oracle mw application, MS SQL under DBA was upgraded up to recent major release version

After:

core DBs were upgraded up to oracle 12c, 10 DB up to newest 19c, rest outdated are in progress. No MS SQL 2008 version, 2012 for all upgrade either planned or in progress,
oracle reports server for w4 upgraded up to 12c, for dm in progress, ALL activity tracked in JIRA, listed in confluence

Compliance stats update for w4/dm core DBs (prod support)

Before:

No common process known for dev and DBA, no rollback possible, not known how exactly testing process should looks like for that, 1,5+ days for dm, 12h for w4

After:

Successfull implementation for w4 with rollback possibility (2,5hours), datamart 12h instead of 36 (planned more improvement), no SLA breach post implementation because of new stats


Preparation of PPROD DBs for any kind of testing (delivery)

before:

Unpredictable time, all manual, activity non transparent, no business process for this, not clear which information is required, required additional storage for backup, 
time to move prob backup for restoration

after:

Restoration automated and performed form bamboo in devOPS manner, business process with clear requirement in JIRA, minimum manual intervention required, all activiy tracked


Preparation of UAT DBs for any kind of testing (delivery)

Before:

Unpredictable time, all manual, activity non transparent, no business process for this, not clear which information is required, required additional storage for backup, 
all DBs related to same functionality having different parameters set

after:

OFA (oracle flexble architecture) implemented for ALL UAT w4/dm DBs and half UAT DBs for other applications which prevent issues related to parameters difference
and makes administration and testing process much easier, almost cloud ready solution in terms of DB parameters set, all parameters tracked under version control system (bitbucket cloud)


Business process, BAU scripts, knowledge sharing (collaboration)

Before:

No common knowledge base, no common standards for DBA BAU, everyone doing in his own way


After:

Confluence (onPrem) knowledge base for DBA team with 11 secions filled with useful data, standards, FAQ, scripts, process description, stuff related to other team communication
status for BAU periodicat activities become more transparent, frequently updated over there


Collaboration (collaboration)

Before:

Only mail, no JIRA/confluence, no whatsup group

After:

Work closely with other teams in UAE onPrem JIRA, work more transparent, whatsup group for DBA, cloud JIRA global team access request in progress


Space savings (OPEX savings)

Before:

No HSK at all in way4db, same data restored in PPROD as well, no space savings neither for rman no for snap DBs

After:

HSK working (not fully, still required improvement from app side) in way4db, all HSK related data excluded from PROD clone DB, all PPROD snaps and rman DB copies
(savings 2.2+ TB per DB, close to 20TB space savings totally), HSK implementation in dm in progress (with eng/imp teams)

How do you think, how all those improval can be estimated?
