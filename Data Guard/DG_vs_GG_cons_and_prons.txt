Oracle Data Guard DG pro:

Fully supported HA solution from Oracle
Can guarantee zero data loss in the case of database, cluster or data corruption failures
DG is supported as default HA solution from OW
Active data guard allow standby DB be available for read only load which will give us possibility to offload it to standby site
Downtime of patching may be decreased by using stanby first patching mechanism
Current DBA in NI is aware of DG technology
Supported thansparent application connection descriptor where app will always connect to either primary os standy DB no matter in which site it will be
Easy switchover and failover with standard data guard manager utility
Potential possibility of using snapshot standby technology if required

contra:

No active/active mode possible. standby DB will be read only (with active standby mode)
No possible to do sync with different versions of Oracle rdbms sw

Oracle Golden Gate GG pro:

active/active mode possible. standby DB will be read only (with active standby mode)
Possible to do sync with different versions of Oracle rdbms sw

contra:

Oracle GoldenGate alone cannot guarantee zero data loss in the case of database, cluster or data corruption failures
No oficial support for GG from OW, DG is supported as default HA solution
Much more efforts required to administer/setup and make changes in existing GG configuration
Additional licencing (payment) required for GG
Lack of resources with GG experience for support GG as HA in PROD
Additional SW + changes in ALL DBs required
Swichover more complicated in comparicon with DG
Failover and futher configuration restoration extremely complicated in comparicon with DG
Global change in current architecture required for active-active mode support from all apps


So DG is recommended approach for enterprise HA realization.
