ORA-28040: No matching authentication protocol

set

SQLNET.ALLOWED_LOGON_VERSION_SERVER=8
SQLNET.ALLOWED_LOGON_VERSION_CLIENT=8 

in sqlnet.ora file

if using SQLNET.ALLOWED_LOGON_VERSION, will be warnings in alertlog!

Now now some background about the authentication protocol behavior. In earlier Oracle versions there was a 1-1 relation between authentication protocol and Oracle client version. This behavior changed in Oracle 10g , starting with Oracle 10g, this is no longer a 1-1 relation between authentication protocol and Oracle client version.  So what is the problem?  the problem lies in the fact that both Oracle 10g and 11g use SHA-1 protocol where as Oracle 12c uses SHA-2 protocol.  While SHA-2 protocol by itself is not causing the error, It is the default setting for SQLNET.ALLOWED_LOGON_VERSION_SERVER that is causing the error. In earlier versions , the default was 8 whereas it is 11 in Oracle 12c; therefore all  client versions 10 and below may get ORA-28040 error.

Please note that  SQLNET.ALLOWED_LOGON_VERSION parameter is deprecated in Oracle Database 12c and replaced with SQLNET.ALLOWED_LOGON_VERSION_SERVER  and SQLNET.ALLOWED_LOGON_VERSION_CLIENT.

Other ways to fix the above issue is to upgrade your client like JDBC drivers to  12c to match authentication protocols.
